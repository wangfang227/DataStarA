not forgive me Please you as I have not I opened my eyes and looked at the blank Forget you my expectations Finished dependence I soon left Kumi sunny sky Still keep your smile Cried but can not bury

in the opposite direction Words: Vincent Fang Music: Jay Vacantly misty dream to you Cracks aching How did you communicate empty That I can not speak useless How different his smile I no longer favored in your heart My sky the wind or rain rainbow You manipulate Really I hate myself useless emotion It is still a heart to ache Also moved in front to break up the phrase Sorry Shuttle screen time clock Moved from the opposite direction Back to the original time and space love you Stop-motion content infidelity All my memories against attack My wounds opened by you Tears oath is too heavy to be condoned Face raging out of control City neon restless beating Red sky in the past for various Like a dream afraid to touch I thought on the pain of heartbreak content Every second different You do not understand even a treasure There are also difficulties do not want to send Cold chimney ruins Stopped all come to nothing Blindly follow the crowd Others dream full indulgence I hate no use of healing No dream is not moving I do not know the severity of pain Tears red round indulgence Really I hate myself useless emotion It is still a heart to ache Also moved in front to break up the phrase Sorry Shuttle screen time clock Moved from the opposite direction Back to the original time and space love you Stop-motion content infidelity All my memories against attack My wounds opened by you Tears oath is too heavy to be condoned Face raging out of control Shuttle screen time clock Moved from the opposite direction Back to the original time and space love you Stop-motion content infidelity All my memories against attack Romantic phone Words: Vincent Fang Music: Jay music Gently I was unable to discharge your love That love will slowly increase the weight I want to turn off all the lights on the city To concentrate on the dark smell of your hair incense This very night to make sense of the screen crush recall Your dating place There are reluctant to delete Stored in the mind to enjoy You smile browse phone romance The original really is as simple as sending love On the review screen You look cute I explained about the fate of the addition of a line pass You smile browse phone romance So, love can come so suddenly SMS Bridge The elongated ambiguous Our feelings grow with the spread of writing culture In this virtual soil TV singing Noisy songs are still playing hard I was quiet in the downtown area and other call rings There are some words but did not dare to lay a pass Afraid of embarrassing you receive information I set off the crowd on the street alone Think Who Fortunately beside you But a misunderstanding You were waiting for your cell phone rings You smile browse phone romance The original really is as simple as sending love Brush up on your screen look cute I explained about the fate of the addition of a line pass You smile browse phone romance The love may come so suddenly SMS will only prolong the bridge Our feelings grow with the spread of writing culture In this virtual soil Secret Jay Cold coffee left coaster I hold my emotions behind it Desperately tried to front Still visible on my face Not the most beautiful rainy day It is once you escape the rain roof oh ~~ Memories picture In the swings dreams become less sweet You say love will gradually go down further Why time has come to change You use your finger to stop me to say goodbye Before you completely lose around Imagination You say love will gradually go down further Perhaps the only sign of fate let us meet Just let us fall in love this season Falling after the discovery of this fragment of happiness How I want to pick up Cold coffee left coaster I hold my emotions behind it Desperately tried to front Still visible on my face Not the most beautiful rainy day It is once you escape the rain roof oh ~~ Memories picture In the swings dreams become less sweet You say love will gradually go down further Why time has come to change You use your finger to stop me to say goodbye Before you completely lose around Imagination You say love will gradually go down further Why time has come to change Just let us fall in love this season Falling after the discovery of this fragment of happiness How I want to pick up The longest movie Lyrics: Jay Music: Jay We started It is a very long movie Show three years I still keep ticket Ice Ballet My mind was spinning Looking at you slowly forget you Hazy time We slipped far Skate draw circle Who circled change If we again Will somewhat embarrassed Love is not the only precious not open Give me two minutes Let me remember freezes Do not melt the tears You have spent the makeup to how I remember Remember when you told me to forget it Remember when you told me to forget it You say you cry Not because you care Hazy time We slipped far Skate draw circle Who circled change If we again Will somewhat embarrassed Love is not the only precious not open Give me two minutes Let me remember freezes Do not melt the tears You have spent the makeup to how I remember Remember when you told me to forget it Remember when you told me to forget it You say you cry Not because you care Give me two minutes Let me remember freezes Do not melt the tears You have spent the makeup to how I remember Remember when you told me to forget it Remember when you told me to forget it You say you cry Not because you care ~ ~ Excuse Song: Jay We turned over the photos Miss looming Last winter Our sweet smile Watching you cry face Telling me goodbye Too late to hear You have to go very far Maybe you have abandoned me It might have been difficult to go back I know I missed Please give me a reason why you do not love me Even I do not understand Can you forgive me Please do not break up as your request I know you must go injured excuse You look back I will accompany you all the way to the final Even without result I am also able to withstand I know your pain I gave a commitment You say to me connivance Because silence is inclusive If you go, please remember me We turned over the photos Miss looming Last winter Our sweet smile Watching you cry face Telling me goodbye Too late to hear You have to go very far Maybe you have abandoned me It might have been difficult to go back I know I missed Please give me a reason why you do not love me Even I do not understand Can you forgive me Please do not break up as your request I know you must go injured excuse You look back I will accompany you all the way to the final Even without result I am also able to withstand I know your pain I gave a commitment You say to me connivance Because silence is inclusive If you go, please remember me If you forget me sad Dandelion agreement Lyrics: Vincent Fang Music: Jay Dandelion fence next to the primary school There is the memory of the taste of the scenery Nap playground heard the sound of cicadas Years later it is still good to hear We will send a letter to desire a paper airplane Because we can not wait for that meteor Serious coin decide the fate of the vote But do not know where to go in the end We grew up with agreement As clear as I believe pulled the hook He said we\\'d travel together Today is your only wayward stick Heart thugs left standing in the hallway We note that the window of dragonfly I go to where you are related to very tight Many dreams were waiting We grew up with agreement As clear as I believe pulled the hook He said we\\'d travel together Today is your only wayward stick We grew up with agreement That really And you have endless talk And I\\'ve not tell Are you still miss the friendship of love ~ ~ Broken chord Jay Broken chord again how even I feel that you have not hear Your transition like broken strings Then again how not to sound I can tell you the change I silence you if not more Between us less of what does not say ouch After finally face a little sad smile Hold your hand Q. Are you sure the walk I suddenly relieved smile Laughter circled the hillside Gone with the wind in Shanghai Triad You came around Your tears to fall down He said he would remember my good I also laugh bent the mouth You have the beauty to whom Chase and chase me back or else I understand leaving tree leaves The world belongs to the earth wither Broken chord. Again You are not inside my world My fingertips have pop-up cocoon You still can not stay with me Broken chord again how even I feel that you have not hear Your transition like broken strings Then again how not to sound I can tell you the change I silence you if not more Between us less of what does not say ouch After finally face a little sad smile Hold your hand Q. Are you sure the walk I suddenly relieved smile Laughter circled the hillside Gone with the wind in Shanghai Triad You came around Your tears to fall down He said he would remember my good I also laugh bent the mouth You have the beauty to whom Chase and chase me back or else I understand leaving tree leaves The world belongs to the earth wither Broken chord. Again You are not inside my world My fingertips have pop-up cocoon You still can not stay with me Broken strings and then how to practice I feel that you have not hear Your transition like broken strings Then again how not to sound I can tell you the change Forward Gray sky like crying After you leave and there is no more freedom Sour air Sniff our distance Scene of heartbreaking ending Like breathing, unable to stop Drawer yellowed diary Drained memories That smile summer You are my past clockwise forget After hypoxia love Careless tears are unnecessary I know you and I are not wrong

on your face That reduction in rain This alley is too narrow to return to the story These days are not green And a few mottled I evacuated the remaining memories in the house, The seats Distance in between Feelings you do not play chess with his rival Had a chance to carefully write down on your Describe how I love you But you smile away from me This feeling is not right My efforts to restore Some of these should be considerate of feeling I did not give Duzui promise you desire very humble in compromise I ignore you but to accompany This feeling is not right I finally understand A page could not bear to read the plot you tired You memorized my shed tears several times more haggard And my heart you suffer your beauty I do not deserve This street is too crowded Too many people have a secret Mist on the glass in the past has been hidden Emotion on your face That reduction in rain This alley is too narrow to return to the story These days are not green And a few mottled I evacuated the remaining memories in the house, The seats Distance in between Feelings you do not play chess with his rival Had a chance to carefully write down on your Describe how I love you But you smile away from me This feeling is not right My efforts to restore Some of these should be considerate of feeling I did not give Duzui promise you desire very humble in compromise I ignore you but to accompany

come true Perhaps time is a kind I\\'m taking right now is poison See your smile, how I fall asleep Your shadow so close I could not hold Earth around the sun or will not There is no reason I can go your own I know you have to leave very simple You say that our dependence is hampered Even up, but could not confiscate my love Finally, as I came to understand Is there a mask to me Relieved to say too much not to come true Perhaps time is a kind I\\'m taking right now is poison See your smile, how I fall asleep Your shadow so close I could not hold Earth around the sun or will not There is no reason I can go your own I know you have to leave very simple You say that our dependence is hampered Even up, but could not confiscate my love Finally, as I came to understand See you smile How I want to sleep with Your shadow so close I could not hold No earth around the sun will still be around There is no reason I can myself gone Relieved to say too much not to come true Maybe time is an

not Fly\" Hello everyone I\\'m Jay my latest single, \"Superman Can not Fly,\" I hope you like this song my mother said a lot of things just do not be too care about the mission to find and asked if I could not sleep to curse a little trick I will add a little melody you\\'ll feel super good not my gun loaded ammunition so rest assured that no one beat me down the Green Hornet is confident because I do not need to substitute painting pigment I do a lot of things the meaning behind the willing you think just to shoot a TV moment exhausted dream high the ratings is also difficult to see the great ideal of my life because I do not need more sum of that award I do not know when it became known that a model paparazzi Sign reluctantly knocked apology should have the appearance of what I sing the lyrics to a little culture because at any time will be treated as teaching English CNN can not wait to revisit the better modern magazine cover image can retake attention to diet just like anywhere else Madame Tussauds wax I like Chinese theater in Hollywood when there are a lot of fingerprints on the ground to see the footprints of my prize if Superman can fly in the air, let me stop for a stop overlooking this world again makes me feel better to save the planet good Although tired, a little tired but I still do not ask me cried tears not because Superman can not do this song is written in this decade as well as the mentality of singing to bring feelings best male singer can not just take a movie best newcomer you do not attend the award ceremony is rude to you go to is to represent care about you when you moved to tears winners people will think you melodramatic you do not look arrogant people will say if you are born with it and even those who face your mother will blame someone else in the floor final result you have to give full winning applause and smiling to open the car can not be good living in the end I was not too high or good deeds on behalf of a singer-songwriter album must be a champion shot the film must be sold only if really so hard to say when Superman Superman can fly in the air, let me stop for a stop overlooking this world again makes me feel better to save the planet tired although a little tired but I still Do not ask me would cried tears not because Superman can not hope Yi cold fireworks satisfaction song: Jay words: Vincent

heartbroken thoughts I lay quietly wind revolt micro shake your shadow constantly left alone I\\'m alone in the lake grief hurt falling flowers have finished brilliant City trail withered hand touch alone bear tied firewood worry heart split in half a lifetime of love that he has not shaken the country who hoofs rattled me a military uniform whistling vicissitudes your day a little brighter night melancholy sigh softly so tactful chrysanthemum brilliant burn your smile has yellowed flowers were heartbroken thoughts I lay quietly wind revolt micro shake your shadow left me helpless and alone in the lake alone depressed daisy brightly burn your smile has yellowed flowers were heartbroken my mind lying quietly micro wind revolt shake your shadow constantly left alone I\\'m alone in the lake grief to say goodbye dawn rain you go clear my love lost leaves floating on the lake asleep can not afford to put up wanted tears in Gone with the Wind look at you to see if you can not see me pretend the past is not important only to find himself found impossible to say goodbye never see I can not just lose your legs while you stay lipstick smile I find If you can not swap the role of good to say goodbye discovered never see so endured the pain can not afford to say good tears accompany me to the old and hard where to go hug again a minute of all good morning rain you got to go clear my love lost leaves floating on the lake fell asleep not want to put up floating in tears you see if you look at the past to pretend I do not see the matter but found himself impossible to say goodbye only to find I can never see so lose your legs while you smile lipstick stay if I can not find good roles have been reversed you say you laugh your mind has been good around my hand forget you can not hand picking up a heartbreaking temperature does not return to the former heart sad to say goodbye to the past I could not run away only to find never see so endured the pain can not afford to say good tears accompany me to the old and hard where go hug again a minute all good simple love singer: Jay can not say why I became very active when a person fall in love with what I think will be worthwhile for you to announce loudly next door neighbors are reluctant to even guess what I\\'m feeling river flowing hair blowing in the wind to hold your hand while inexplicably touched I want to take you back to my grandmother watched the sunset together until we were asleep I want to just hold your hand can not let go of love can not always be sad I simply did not want to take you biking I want to watch baseball did not want to worry about has been taking singing I wanted to just hold your hand and do not let go of love can not hurt you simply rely on I fell asleep on the shoulder you live in
